    <h1>FAITHTIME TOP-UP AGREEMENT</h1>
    <h3>Last updated: October 14, 2025</h3>
    <div>
        <h2>1. Parties and Scope</h2>
        <p>This Top-up Agreement ("Agreement") is entered into between METAVIBE PTE. LTD. ("Company", "we", "us") and
            you ("you", "user"), and governs your purchase of the in-app virtual currency known as "Spiritual Gems"
            ("Gems") and any associated digital items within the FaithTime mobile application ("App").</p>
        <p>By purchasing or redeeming Gems, you agree to this Agreement in addition to our Terms and Conditions and
            Privacy Policy (collectively, the "Legal Terms"). If you do not agree, do not purchase or use Gems.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>2. Eligibility and Accounts</h2>
        <p>You must have reached the minimum age required by law in your jurisdiction to consent to the processing of
            your personal data and to make in-app purchases.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>3. Platform Billing and Purchase Flows</h2>
        <p>All purchases of Gems are processed through Apple App Store or Google Play (each, a "Platform"). Pricing,
            taxes, billing descriptors, receipts, refunds, and subscription or purchase management are governed by the
            applicable Platform policies.</p>
        <p>We do not offer or support any external or alternative top-up methods outside the App’s authorized in-app
            purchase flows. Any attempt to top up through unofficial channels is prohibited and may lead to account
            actions including reversal of balances, suspension, or termination.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>4. Nature of Gems and License</h2>
        <p>Gems are a limited, revocable, non-exclusive, non-transferable, non-sublicensable license to access certain
            in-app features, experiences, and digital items within the App. Gems have no cash or real-world monetary
            value and are not a stored value, deposit, or payment instrument.</p>
        <p>You do not own Gems or digital items; you receive a license for personal, non-commercial use within the App,
            subject to the Legal Terms.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>5. Delivery of Gems</h2>
        <p>Upon a successful Platform purchase authorization, Gems will typically be delivered to your in-app balance
            promptly. Delivery times may vary due to Platform processing, network conditions, or system maintenance. If
            you do not receive Gems after a reasonable period, contact support with the Platform receipt.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>6. Pricing, Taxes, and Regional Variations</h2>
        <p>Prices are displayed within the App and may vary by region, currency, Platform, and applicable taxes.
            Platform tax collection and remittance may apply according to local law. Promotional or bonus Gems may be
            time-limited and subject to additional terms shown in-App.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>7. No Cash-Out; Non-Transferability</h2>
        <p>Gems and digital items are not redeemable or refundable for money or monetary value, and cannot be sold,
            traded, gifted, or transferred to other accounts or third parties, except where explicitly enabled in the
            App and permitted by Platform rules.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>8. Refunds and Chargebacks</h2>
        <p>All Gem purchases are final and non-refundable, except where a refund is required by applicable law or
            permitted by the applicable Platform’s policies. Any Platform-approved refund may result in a corresponding
            reversal or deduction of Gems or digital items from your account.</p>
        <p>If you initiate a chargeback or dispute with the Platform or your payment provider, we may suspend your
            access to Gems and digital items pending resolution, and adjust your balances to reflect the outcome.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>9. Errors, Adjustments, and Fraud Prevention</h2>
        <p>We may review and correct your Gem or digital item balances for errors and may suspend, reverse, or void
            transactions suspected to involve fraud, unauthorized activity, exploits, or abuse (including receipt
            manipulation and chargeback abuse).</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>
            10. Expiration, Forfeiture, and Feature Changes
        </h2>
        <p>We may modify, suspend, or discontinue features that use Gems, including events, rewards, and redemption
            mechanics. Where required by law, we will provide prior notice. Upon account termination or as otherwise
            permitted by law and Platform policies, any remaining Gems or digital items may be forfeited.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>11. Randomized Rewards and Probabilities</h2>
        <p>If any feature uses randomized rewards (e.g., draws or loot-box-like mechanics), applicable probabilities
            will be disclosed within the App at the point of use. Probabilities may vary by event or item pool.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>12. Prohibited Conduct</h2>
        <p>You must not: (a) acquire or exchange Gems outside authorized Platform flows; (b) resell, trade, or transfer
            Gems or items; (c) use exploits, automation, or unauthorized tools; or (d) engage in fraud, chargeback
            abuse, or receipt manipulation. We may take any action permitted by the Legal Terms for violations.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>13. Promotions and Bonus Gems</h2>
        <p>We may offer bonus Gems, discounts, or promotional events from time to time. Such offers may be subject to
            additional terms and may be modified or withdrawn at our discretion, where permitted by law.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>14. Support and Disputes About Delivery</h2>
        <p>For delivery issues, please contact us with your Platform receipt ID, transaction date, and account ID. We
            may request logs or additional verification to investigate.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>15. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution</h2>
        <p>This Agreement is governed by the laws of Singapore. Any dispute arising out of or in connection with this
            Agreement shall be finally resolved by arbitration administered by the Singapore International Arbitration
            Centre (SIAC) under the SIAC Rules. The tribunal shall consist of one (1) arbitrator, the seat and venue
            shall be Singapore, and the language shall be English.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>16. Relationship to Legal Terms</h2>
        <p>This Agreement supplements the Terms and Conditions and forms part of the Legal Terms. In the event of a
            conflict, the Terms and Conditions control except where this Agreement specifically governs Gem purchases
            and usage.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <h2>17. Changes and Severability</h2>
        <p>We may update this Agreement to reflect changes in features, Platform rules, or applicable laws. Updates take
            effect upon posting in the App or as otherwise stated. If any provision is held invalid or unenforceable,
            the remaining provisions will remain in full force and effect.</p>
